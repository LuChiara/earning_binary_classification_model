## Predicting Income from Census Data
This project uses the 1996 U.S. Census Income dataset—commonly referred to as the "Census Income" or "Adult" dataset—to build a predictive model that determines whether an individual's annual income exceeds $50K.

## Objective
The goal is to develop a classification model that predicts whether a person earns more than $50,000 per year based on demographic and employment-related attributes.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset includes a mix of categorical and numerical features. Below is a summary of the key variables:age, workclass, fnlwgt, education, education-num, marital-status, occupation, relationship, race, sex, capital-gain, capital-loss, hours-per-week, native-country, income.
